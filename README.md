# nine-men-s-morris_2017-18

University group project. I commited as root.

Nine-men-s-morris game that communicates with the university server via TCP. 
There are two processes, one communicates with the server and the other one handles the game logic.
They communicate via signals and shared memory.

The client game logic is random but is programmed to make valid moves against the server.
